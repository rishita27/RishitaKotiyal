I am a Data Science enthusiast, interested in learning new technologies💡 and their real-time implementation. I am a Masters Student👩‍🎓 at Dalhousie University. A part of me loves learning and sharing my knowledge in a way that's as accessible to the public as possible 📚. I have recently worked on a few projects in Machine Learning and Visual Analytics and will continue to do so in the future ☺️.
